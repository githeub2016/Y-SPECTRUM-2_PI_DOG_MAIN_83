Y-spectrum-2 (youtube channel)
This is a 4 legged walking robot puppy project I built myself, and contains only 3 code files, using python and pygame, targeting raspberry pi 3 platform but can also run on Windows PC if you install python and pygame i'm using python IDLE version(3.5.3) and pygame 1.9.4

Soredog_Main.py contains the controller code of the robot (simple AI) and you should Run the program from there on your python IDLE.

 I removed the adafruit sensor related code and other non essential code to increase code compatibility, readability and reduce complexity, so even if you donâ€™t have the sensors installed on your project you can run this code without error.

There is a function called DriveServos() in the Global_Essentials_Class.py which is the output that provides angle data to tell the servos what position to go and what speed.
